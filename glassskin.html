  <h2>✨ What Is Glass Skin?</h2>
  <p>Glass skin is a complexion that's smooth, clear, highly hydrated and almost reflective—like glass. It’s not about heavy makeup; it’s about healthy, glowing skin from within.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</p>

  <h2>📋 Step-by-Step Routine</h2>

  <h3>1. Double Cleanse</h3>
  <p>Use an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup/sunscreen, then a gentle water-based cleanser to clear impurities. Clinique fans swear by gel variants that leave skin soft and clean.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>

  <h3>2. Exfoliate (2x/week)</h3>
  <p>Use a soft chemical exfoliant with AHA or BHA to slough off dead skin cells and brighten texture—a must for smooth glow.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p>

  <h3>3. Hydrating Toner / Essence</h3>
  <p>Rebalance pH and flood skin with moisture. Lightweight toners or essences prep the skin for better product absorption.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</p>

  <h3>4. Brightening Serum (Niacinamide + Hyaluronic Acid)</h3>
  <p>This is your glow powerhouse: brightens, hydrates, and evens skin tone over time. Choose top-rated serums with niacinamide & HA.:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</p>

  <h3>5. Moisturizer</h3>
  <p>Seal in hydration with a lightweight gel or cream that still lets skin breathe—products like Neutrogena Hydro Boost are often recommended.:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</p>

  <h3>6. Face Oil or Sleeping Mask (Optional)</h3>
  <p>For an extra glow, pat a few drops of facial oil or use an overnight mask once or twice a week.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</p>

  <h3>7. SPF Every Morning</h3>
  <p>This final step protects your radiant skin from UV damage and maintains its clarity and glow.</p>
