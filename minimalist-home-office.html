    <p>Minimalism isn’t just about fewer things — it’s about more purpose. A minimalist home office can help reduce distractions, boost productivity, and create a peaceful work environment. Here’s how to create one that feels intentional and inspiring.</p>

    <h2>1. Start with the Essentials</h2>
    <p>Only keep items that you truly need: a desk, a comfortable chair, and your laptop or desktop. Remove anything that doesn’t serve a daily purpose. This will immediately open up visual space.</p>

    <h2>2. Choose Neutral Colors</h2>
    <p>Use a calming palette — whites, greys, light wood tones — to reflect light and promote clarity. You can add warmth with soft textiles like a rug or curtains.</p>

    <h2>3. Declutter and Hide Cables</h2>
    <p>Use <a href="https://amzn.to/your-link1" target="_blank">cable organizers</a> or a cable box to keep wires out of sight. Minimalism often starts with visual calm, and tangled cords can be a source of distraction.</p>

    <h2>4. Opt for Multipurpose Furniture</h2>
    <p>Consider a desk with built-in drawers or a shelf unit that doubles as storage. <a href="https://amzn.to/your-link2" target="_blank">Floating wall shelves</a> help store essentials without taking up floor space.</p>

    <h2>5. Add One or Two Personal Touches</h2>
    <p>A small plant, a framed quote, or a photo can add warmth without creating clutter. Keep it intentional — less is more.</p>

    <h2>6. Use Natural Light</h2>
    <p>Set up your workspace near a window if possible. Natural light improves mood and energy, and reduces eye strain.</p>

    <h2>7. Keep Digital Space Clean Too</h2>
    <p>Minimalism isn’t just physical. Organize your desktop files, email inbox, and bookmarks regularly to keep your mental space clutter-free as well.</p>

    <p>Creating a minimalist home office is about balance, not bare walls. Make it work for you — clean, calm, and focused.</p>
